# BTC DCA Reminder App

A modern cross-platform Bitcoin Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) reminder application, designed to help users make smart investments based on the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart theory. Developed with Flutter.

## App Features

### Detailed Rainbow DCA Algorithm
The core of this application is its intelligent DCA algorithm, based on the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart theory. By logarithmically regressing historical price trends, the price range is divided into different "rainbow zones," with corresponding buying multiplier suggestions for each zone. This helps users maintain rationality during market volatility, buying more when undervalued and less when overvalued.

| Rainbow Zone | Price Status | Suggested Multiplier | Investment Strategy |
|--------------|--------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| ðŸ”µ Deep Blue | Extremely Undervalued | 3.0x | Historical buying opportunity, significantly increase investment |
| ðŸ”µ Blue | Severely Undervalued | 2.0x | Market significantly undervalued, increase investment proportion |
| ðŸŸ¢ Green | Slightly Undervalued | 1.5x | Market moderately undervalued, can increase investment |
| ðŸŸ¡ Yellow | Fair Value | 1.0x | Market at fair value, follow normal DCA rhythm |
| ðŸŸ  Orange | Slightly Overvalued | 0.75x | Market slightly overvalued, appropriately reduce investment pace |
| ðŸ”´ Red | Significantly Overvalued | 0.5x | Market significantly overvalued, greatly reduce investment proportion |
| ðŸ”´ Deep Red | Severely Overvalued | 0.25x | Market severely overvalued, maintain minimal investment |
| ðŸŸ£ Bubble | Bubble Phase | 0.1x | Market in irrational bubble phase, minimize investment, consider partial profit-taking |

## Configuration Instructions

### Modify Base Investment Amount
You can adjust your base DCA amount in the `lib/services/rainbow_dca_service.dart` file:
```dart
// lib/services/rainbow_dca_service.dart
static const double baseAmount = 100.0; // Modify to your desired daily base DCA amount (e.g., 100.0 USDT)
```

### Adjust Rainbow Multipliers
The buying multipliers for the Rainbow DCA can be customized in `lib/services/rainbow_dca_service.dart`:
```dart
// lib/services/rainbow_dca_service.dart
static const Map<double, double> rainbowMultipliers = {
  0.45: 3.0,  // Deep Blue Zone: Historical opportunity, 3x buy
  0.60: 2.0,  // Blue Zone: Severely undervalued, 2x buy
  0.75: 1.5,  // Green Zone: Slightly undervalued, 1.5x buy
  0.90: 1.0,  // Yellow Zone: Fair value, 1x buy
  1.05: 0.75, // Orange Zone: Slightly overvalued, 0.75x buy
  1.20: 0.5,  // Red Zone: Significantly overvalued, 0.5x buy
  1.35: 0.25, // Deep Red Zone: Severely overvalued, 0.25x buy
  1.50: 0.1,  // Bubble Zone: Bubble phase, 0.1x buy
};
```

### Set Reminder Time
The daily reminder time can be configured in `lib/services/notification_scheduler.dart`. By default, it's set to 9 AM daily.
```dart
// lib/services/notification_scheduler.dart
// For example, set to remind daily at 9 AM
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.zonedSchedule(
  0, // id
  'BTC DCA Reminder', // title
  'It's time for today's Bitcoin DCA!', // body
  _nextInstanceOfNineAM(), // Next reminder time
  // ... Other configurations
);

```
